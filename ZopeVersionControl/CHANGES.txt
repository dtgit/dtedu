  ZopeVersionControl 0.3 (2004/04/20)

    - Refined the pattern for maintaining parts of objects independently
      of version control.  This is a generalization of the mechanism for
      versioning container items.  IVersionedContainer is now named
      INonVersionedData and has more descriptive method names.

    - 'updateResource' and 'uncheckoutResource' now retain the identity
      of the object being versioned.  That is, they never replace an
      object with a new object, but instead change the state of an
      existing object.

      'updateResource' and 'uncheckoutResource' used to replace the
      object in its container, but this strategy had two flaws:

        1. It required ZopeVersionControl to use the ObjectManager API.
           Version control should not require versionable objects to be
           contained in ObjectManagers.

        2. It assumes that versionable objects are simply wrapped using
           acquisition.  References (symlink-like objects) break this
           assumption.
