Ploneboard to-do list
=====================

    Features
    --------

    - How/where/whether should threaded_conversation_view be enabled
        - per user preference? per forum?
        - does it cause confusion if different users have different views?

    - Use title-to-id generation (with numerical suffixes to remove
        collisions) on conversations, on comments?
            - note: comment urls are rarely/never shown to the user

    - New converstion stars should disappear when conversation has been viewed
            - should be subject to a placeful cookie, and only disappear when
                actually viewed (i.e. if you log in to a different part of the
                site, it should not remove this info for all forums)
            - should be possible to "mark all as viewed" manually

    - Use KSS style edit widgets where possible

    Missing tests
    -------------

    - Functional tests for threaded_conversation_view (see above)
    - Functional tests for global board view template (see above)
    - Coverage of PloneboardTool's transform management is sub-optimal

    Code structure
    --------------

    - Use Plone 3 style views in view templates
    - Split up posting macros, as entire template is evaluated each time a
        macro is used.

    Discussion tool integration
    ----------------------------

    - Should have an aggregate page which shows all discussions going on in the
        portal
    - Should be able to adapt Discussion Item to IComment, discussion
        container to IConversation?

    Future/nice-to-have
    -------------------

    - Mail/news gateway - possibility of integrating with 'listen'?
