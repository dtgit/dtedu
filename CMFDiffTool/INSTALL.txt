HOW TO INSTALL CMFDiffTool

CMFDiffTool installs just as any other Plone product.

Untar it in your Products directory with

- tar -zxvf CMFDiffTool

- Restart your Plone instance

- Login as admin in your Plone-instance

- use the portal_quickinstaller tool in the ZMI, or
(Add/Remove Products) in your Plone Site Setup interface to install it.

In the ZMI in your instance you will find a portal_diff tool already
waiting for you.

You can use the portal_diff tool to determine what properties of an object
will be used to calculate diffs.  Select the Portal Type (ATFile, 
Document, ..) by dropdown list, the Field Name (title,description, body, file)
you wish to use (which you have to know by name), and the Diff Type 
(Lines Diff, ..) by dropdown list to compare the different data.

For contentypes built with archetypes, there is a special diff that will
examine all fields described by the Schema.  To enable it select your type,
put 'any' in the field name input, and select 'Compound diff for AT types'
for the Diff Type.

Congratulations and happy diff'ing
