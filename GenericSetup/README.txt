GenericSetup Product README

  Overview

    This product provides a mini-framework for expressing the configured
    state of a Zope Site as a set of filesystem artifacts.  These artifacts
    consist of declarative XML files, which spell out the configuration
    settings for each "tool" in the site , and supporting scripts / templates,
    in their "canonical" filesystem representations.

  Configurations Included

    The 'setup_tool' knows how to export / import configurations and scripts
    for the following tools:

      - (x) removal / creation of specified tools

      - (x) itself :)

      - (x) the role / permission map on the "site" object (its parent)

      - (x) properties of the site object

      - (x) placeful utilities and adapters registered in the local
            site manager. Placeless utilities can only be imported.

  Extending The Tool

    Third-party products extend the tool by registering handlers for
    import / export of their unique tools.

    See doc/handlers.txt for a step by step how-to.

  Providing Profiles

    GenericSetup doesn't ship with any profile. They have to be provided by
    third-party products and depend on the registered handlers.

    See doc/profiles.txt for more details.
