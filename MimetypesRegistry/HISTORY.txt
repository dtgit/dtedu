    [hannosch]

1.4.0-beta1 - 2006-03-26
========================

  * fixed Plone #5027: MimeTypeRegistry.classify doesn't handle 
    "no mimetype" gracefully. Returns 'None' now.
    [jensens]

  * fixed http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/622
    [jensens] 

1.4.0-alpha02 - 2006-02-23
==========================

  * ensured that the key gotten back from windows_mimetypes.py existed
    mark says the best way is to examine each key to ensure its valid but
    would be slower.
    [runyaga]

    [jensens]

  * Removed BBB code for CMFCorePermissions import location.
    [hannosch]

  * removed deprecation warning for ToolInit.

    PortalTransforms.
    [jensens]

1.3.8-final02 - 2006-01-15
==========================

  * nothing - the odd version checking needs a version change to stick to
    Archetypes version again.
    [yenzenz]

1.3.8-RC1 - 2005-12-29
======================

  * Split yet another part of register() into a separate
    method. Cleanup smi_mimetypes initialize a little bit to to use
    the new method when adding new mimetypes to a already-registered
    entry.
    [dreamcatcher]

  * Include aliases in the list of mimetypes for a entry. Based on
    patch by Jean Jordaan
    [dreamcatcher]

  * Use a SAX-based parser instead of minidom to improve Zope startup
    time (by 17 seconds on my Pismo) and memory footprint.
    [dreamcatcher]

  * Augment known mimetypes with Windows mimetypes, if available.
    [dreamcatcher]

1.3.7-final01 - 2005-10-11
==========================

  * For the sake of sanity, include a 'mime.types' with
    MimetypesRegistry to minimize the platform-specific differences in
    mime detection when the python 'mimetypes' module is involved.
    [dreamcatcher]

  * globs from freedesktop.org shared-mime-info were incorrectly
    mapped to 'extensions' and never really worked because the code
    tried to strip a leading dot, where the globs normally had '*.'.

    The side-effect of this is that in *nix, the Python 'mimetypes'
    module would happily read '/etc/mime.types' and gracefully work
    (/etc/mime.types has most of the extensions of shared-mime-info
    but a few), where on Windows it would fail to detect mimetypes by
    extension.
    [dreamcatcher]

  * Added support for real globs, using fnmatch.translate and
    re.compile and a migration function that will be run from Plone
    2.1.1 migration, with some tests specific for globs read from
    shared-mime-info.
    [dreamcatcher]

1.3.6-final01 - 2005-08-30
==========================

  * after one night sleeping over it I removed the yesterday added method.
    therefore I added according to some heuristics and OOo-Documentation
    some magic bytes to magic.py and made better tests.
    [yenzenz]

  * added a method to detect mimetypes of zipped files,
    here specialy for OOo now all Openofice files and zip
    files are detected properly.  my simple tests are working:
    a OOo-Writer and a simpe zipfile are detected.
    [yenzenz]

  * updated freedesktop.org.xml file to latest CVS version rev 1.57 from
    http://cvs.freedesktop.org/mime/shared-mime-info/freedesktop.org.xml
    [yenzenz]

1.3.5-final03 - 2005-08-07
==========================

  * nothing - the odd version checking needs a version change to stick to
    Archetypes version again.
    [yenzenz]

1.3.5-final02 - 2005-08-01
==========================

 * nothing again, need to stick to Archetypes version
   [yenzenz]

========================

  * Added Five/Zope3 interface bridges and implements
    [tiran]

1.3.4-final - 2005-07-06
========================

  * added icons for openoffice.org files
    [yenzenz]

1.3.3-final06 - 2005-05-20
==========================

  * nothing (I hate to write this. But the odd version checking needs it).
    [yenzenz]

1.3.3-final-02 - 2005-03-25
===========================

  * nothing

1.3.3-final - 2005-03-05
========================

 * More a workaround than a fix for [ 1056252 ] Content type algorithm
   can be confused.
   [tiran]

 * workaround for [ 1068001 ] BaseUnit Encoding Error: macintosh
   [yenzenz]

 * In the case all else fails, try to resort to guess_content_type so
   that at least we don't get 'text/plain' when the file is in fact a
   binary file.
   [dreamcatcher]

1.3.2-5 - 2004-09-30
====================

 * nothing
