PloneLanguageTool 1.6 - Released April 22, 2007

    - Fix javascript bug that prevented the 'flagless' language selection
      drop down from having an effect.  FireBug complained: "this.options is
      not a function" and indeed it is an array.
      [maurits]

    - Added a ccTLD based language negotiator.
      [wichert]

    - Added note about deprecation of the local language and country addition
      functionality and the corresponding methods. According to
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6006 and
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6007 these never worked anyways.
      [hannosch]

PloneLanguageTool 1.5 - Released December 15, 2006

    - Fixed bug in request language negotiation. If the tool is configured not
      to use combined language codes, we have to use the basic language code in
      all places. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5804 and
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5941.
      [hannosch]

    - Added missing Chamorro language to the basic listing.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5836.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed obsolete testSkeleton.
      [hannosch]

    - Changed the native Name of 'rm' to 'Rumantsch'. 
      [jensens]

PloneLanguageTool 1.4 - Released September 8, 2006

    - Changed the browser language based negotiation to recognize combined
      language codes as the base language if only the base language is allowed
      and specified in the browser. So if the browser requests the site in
      'de-de' and only 'de' is allowed for the site, it is recognized as 'de'.
      If the usage of combined language codes is explicitly enabled this
      fallback is not applied, so you can still have full control over combined
      codes as well. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5784.
      [hannosch]

PloneLanguageTool 1.3 - Released June 17, 2006

    - Use the Norwegian flag for Nynorsk.
      [limi]

    - Removed all accidentally added country flags in 16x16 PNG format again
      and converted them to 14x11 GIF format. Transparent PNG don't work in IE.
      [limi]

    - Fixed changing supported languages in the control panel. It silently
      failed for the case of only one resulting supported language.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed displaying flags in the portlet_languages by using
      getFlagForLanguageCode.
      [jladage]

    - Cleaned up switchLanguage.py because it contained a lot of I18NLayer
      specific code. I added the original file to I18NLayer. Also changed .gif
      to .png in the portlet_languages.
      [jladage]

    - Readded flag for Esperanto, we use flag-eo.png as there's no country code.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5547.
      [hannosch]

PloneLanguageTool 1.2 - Released June 1, 2006

    - Readded flag for Basque country, currently we use flag-eu.png as there's
      no official country code in the ISO 3166 standard.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5522.
      [hannosch]

    - Use Central African Republic (cf) flag for Sangho (sg). This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5339.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed the unused i18n folder.
      [hannosch]

PloneLanguageTool 1.1 - Released May 15, 2006

    - Avoid DeprecationWarning for product_name.
      [hannosch]

    - Replaced the available language selector in the preference panel with a
      new one, which shows both the original and the english language names as
      well as the country flag which might be used for the language switcher
      and the language code. It is possible to sort on any of these criteria as
      well as on the 'selected' status by clicking on the table heading.
      [hannosch] [limi]

    - Removed all language flags in 15x12 GIF format and replaced them with
      16x16 PNG country flags. These are named flag-<country code>.png. The
      country codes follow the ISO 3166 standard. The mapping of flags to
      languages is now more flexibly handled through a new underlying format in
      availablelanguages.py, which would allow to map the same flag to more than
      one language without having to duplicate the file as it was needed with
      the former approach.
      [hannosch] [limi]

PloneLanguageTool 1.0 - Released March 19, 2006

    - Added a Welsh flag.
      [russf]

    - Adding flags for Bosnia and Serbia. Jakub Steiner, you rock!
      [limi]

    - Converted some runtime tests to doctests.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed Latvian language name. Thanks to Michael Dexter for the heads up.
      [deo]

PloneLanguageTool 0.9 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Fix http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4959 - if the default language was
      not contained in the supported languages the config form showed a false
      default language and the form had to be saved again to get the desired
      result. Now in this special case the default language is set to the first
      supported language.
      [hannosch]

    - Added removeCountry and removeLanguage methods as counterpart for the
      corresponding add-methods. Added some basic tests.
      [hannosch]

    - Added start_neutral content language setting. Now you can control
      if the content should start as language neutral or in the current
      selected language.
      [deo]

    - Fix http://plone.org/collector/4815 - misspelled i18n msgid
      [hannosch]

PloneLanguageTool 0.8 - Released October 8, 2005

      prefs_languages.pt
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4681 - fixed missing p-tag in
      portal_languages/manage_configForm
      [hannosch]
