2005-05-29 Hanno Schlichting <plone@hannosch.info>

	* provide a new tool: i18ngenerator.py it uses PloneTestCase to start up
	a standard Plone instance and collects all strings needing translation
	from it. This is used to kill a lot of msgids from manual.pot that needed
	manual updating.

	merge two pot's into another one in one step (useful for manual + generated)

	are in the msgstr's and written correctly
