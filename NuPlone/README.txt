About

  NuPlone is a "taste of things to come", as much as an example of how
  radically different a theme for Plone can look, using just CSS.
  
  It's a design exploration meant to inform the next-generation default Plone
  look, but it's also usable in its own right.
  
  In addition, it serves as a good example of advanced CSS styles in Plone:
  
  - It is much cleaner and more compact than the old Plone CSS, which has
    grown to become quite bloated over the last 5 years. If you want to learn
    about CSS and Plone, this is a great starting point.
    
  - It's an example of a static layout as opposed to the fluid layout of
    default Plone.
    
  - It is logically grouped and well-commented.

  - It's much smaller (~25K uncompressed!)

Tips

  NuPlone is a bit different from the standard theme, and the following tweaks
  will help you get closer to what the designers intended:
  
  - Add the search portlet as the topmost portlet in the left column.
  
  - Turn off icon display in "Theme settings".
  
Caveats

  Being a new theme, this hasn't received the amount of testing and quality
  assurance that has gone into the default Plone theme over the years, so we
  suspect there are bugs in various browsers, especially in Internet Explorer.
  
  It is also implemented on top of the standard table-for-layout setup in the
  default theme - please note that it's easy to make this theme tableless if
  you should wish to do so. We have to ship something that is more robust in
  broken browsers like Internet Explorer by default, though.
  
  If you find any bugs (or even better: solutions for these bugs), please 
  report them in the "Plone issue tracker", selecting 'NuPlone theme' as the
  component.
  
  We hope you like it!
