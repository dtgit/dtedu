    BaseRegistry.generateId(). This fixes #7048.
    [davconvent]

1.4.0
=====

  * Add support for automatic grouping mode to the GenericSetup export/import
    code.
    [wichert]

1.4.0-rc1
=========

 * Added a new automatic grouping mode feature. It is turned off by default.
   When enabled the resources will first be sorted into groups with the same
   merging-relevant settings and after that merged. In the groups the order of
   the resources in the registries will be preserved.
   [hannosch]

 * Changed the exportimport handlers to only cook the resources once at the end
   and not after each new resource has been added.
   [hannosch]

1.4.0-beta5

   [fschulze]

1.4.0-alpha2
============

 * Started to use views and viewlet managers.
   [fschulze]

   [fschulze]

 * Fixed typo which prevented position-after/insert-after in GS profiles to
   work.
   [fschulze]

1.3.7
=====

 * For compatibility with GenericSetup conventions, the import steps now
   support 'insert-before' and  'insert-after' as aliases for
   'position-before' and 'position-after', while 'insert-top' and
   'insert-bottom' are aliases for 'position-top' and 'position-bottom',
   respectively.
   [mj]

1.3.6
=====

 * Invalidate cache when cooking resources if the registry is assigned to a
   RAMCache or similar cache manager.

 * Fixed string replacement during packing when several resources got packed
   in different threads at once, which resulted in exchanged strings.
   [fschulze]

1.3.5
=====

 * Fixed string protection for strings which mix single and double quotes.
   [fschulze]

 * Made packer.py usable as a standalone commandline tool.
   [fschulze]

 * Fixed several issues in 'full' compression.
   [fschulze]
   
 * Extended the GenericSetup import step to support positioning of resources:
   the 'position-before' and 'position-after' attributes cause the resource
   to be positioned before or after resource named in the attribute. 
   'position-top' and 'position-bottom' move a resource to the top or bottom.
   [mj]

1.3.4
=====

 * Improved IE conditional compilation protection, it now works in "full"
   compression.
   [fschulze]

 * Improved regular expression for strings.
   [fschulze]

 * Fixed order of oneline and multiline comment removal in javascript packer.

   portal creation)
   [rafrombrc]

1.2.4
=====

 * Made enabled checkbox work again.
   [fschulze]

1.2.3
=====

 * Backported several fixes from 1.3.1:
   [fschulze]

     - Enable use of z3 / Five resources.
       [ree]

     - Mark missing or unaccessible ressources in management screens.
       [fschulze]

     - Moved 'enabled' checkbox into legend before 'id' textbox.
       [fschulze]

     - Don't remove conditional compile instructions for IE from javascripts.
       [fschulze]

     - Fixed error when content is unicode.
       [rocky]

1.2.2
=====

 * Added missing arguments in resource adding functions.
   [jenner, fschulze]

1.2.1
=====

 * Fixed traversal of security restricted resources.
   [jenner, alecm, fschulze]

 * Added javascript "full" compression, which achieves higher compression ratios
   by doing variable name packing based on the rules from Dean Edwards packer:
   http://dean.edwards.name/packer/usage/
   [fschulze]

 * Added keyword encoding for javascript. This greatly reduces the file size of
   javascript files, but adds a small performance hit on the client for the
   decoding.
   [fschulze]

1.2
===

 * Added compression for CSS and Javascript resources.
   [fschulze]

 * Added better labels and a short explanation to the debugmode-checkbox in the forms. 
   [elvix]

 * Renamed 'TAL condition' to 'Condition' in the forms, as it has nothing to do with 
   TAL at all (it is a CMF/TALES expression) It should include a link to CMF Expressions help
   [elvix]

1.1
===

 * Fixed cooking of resources to ensure that uncookable resources are not merged.
   [elro]

 * Fixed tests for unauthorized to accept a 401 as an unauthorized error.
   [elro]

 * Fixed setDebugMode to recook resources after being changed.
   [elro]

1.1b1
=====

 * Added checkbox to configure cacheability of resources.
   [fschulze]

 * Made registries cacheable. This is most useful with the RAMCacheManager.
   Just associate portal_css and portal_javascripts with the RAMCache.
   [fschulze]

 * Apply magic id to all resources when not in debug mode, so invalidation
   works.
   [fschulze]

 * Made skin aware. This now depends on getCurrentSkinName added in  CMF 1.5.5.
   [elro]

1.0.5
=====

 * Fixed encoding of javascripts.
   [fschulze]

1.0.4
=====

 * Fixed reordering of resources with javascript.
   [fschulze]

1.0.3
=====

 * Fixed typo in the migration external method which lead to portal_javascripts
   not being migrated.
   [fschulze]

 * Small fixes to UI.
   [limi]

1.0.2
=====

 * Fix for bug #4392, where merging FSfiles could mess up http-status headers
   and cause weird hanging in browsers.
   [plonista][fschulze][elvix] 

1.0.1
=====

 * Don't filter resources in merged overview in ZMI.
   [fschulze]

 * Improved management UI.
   [limi, fschulze]

 * Fixed reinstall bug due to improper resource id lookup.
   [alecm]

1.0
===

 * Moved directory with skin layer for Plone 2.0.5 compatibility to product
   root, so it doesn't interfere with Plone 2.1. The version check on install
   time didn't seem to be enough.
   [fschulze]

 * getTitle and getMedia will return None now if they are empty, this removes
   empty title and media attributes from the generated HTML.

 * Fixed reordering of resources in ZMI when javascript is enabled.
   [fschulze, jenner]

 * Fixed submitting changes in ZMI for stylesheets on IE.
   [fschulze]

0.95
====

 * Added getResource function. This allows to change properties of each
   resource. After that, a call to cookResources is needed.
   [fschulze]

 * Added getResourceIds function.
   [fschulze]

 * Added test for context dependancy to inline css rendering.
   [dom]

 * Now uses restrictedTraverse() rather than getattr() for returning resources,
   to provide support for resources held within the ZODB.
   [dom]

 * Added a "is merging allowed?" option ("cookable" property) to determine where
   a resource can be merged (default True). This was added because objects in
   the ZODB may have variable permissions but be merged together. Whilst the
   objects are checked at each REQUEST, a new REQUEST won't actually be made
   each time because of the cache headers set on merged resources. If this
   worries you, the simplest solution is not to merge such resources, hence this
   option.
   [dom]

 * Added renameResource function with tests.
   [fschulze]

 * In Plone 2.1 plone_javascripts.js was removed, fixed tests by using
   jstest.js from our own skin.
   [dom]

0.9
===

 * Fixed function of enabled checkbox when adding css/javascript from ZMI.
   Added title field to the 'add stylesheet' part in the ZMI.
   [fschulze]

 * Added migration script for old instances. Just create a external method with
   id 'migrate_resourceregistries', Module Name 'ResourceRegistries.migrate' and
   Function Name 'migrate' and click on the 'Test' tab.
   [fschulze]

 * Cleaned up imports and whitespaces. Code standardization and small
   improvements. Fixed ZMI templates XHTML markup.
   [deo]

 * Refactored the two registries to use one common base class.
   [fschulze]

 * Refactored moving functions, so we have more possibilities. The API reflects
   the IOrderedContainer one.
   [fschulze]

 * Fix order of javascripts, the topmost in the management screen also needs
   to be the topmost in the resulting source.
   [fschulze]

 * Added debugmode where scripts are not concatenated. This will let things
   like the javascript console point to the right line-number. And makes it
   easier to develop, because there is no caching of the scripts.
   [fschulze]

 * Fixed cooking of stylesheets so that composite stylesheets get correct
   media settings. Thanks a lot to Denis Mishunoff[spliter] for discovery,
   investigation and suggested fix
   [elvix]

 * Fixed some security declarations.
   [fschulze]

 * Made moving of stylesheets and javascripts in ZMI possible without javascript
   being enabled in the browser.
   [fschulze]

 * Moved 2.0.5 header.pt to skins/ResourceRegistries_20compatibility and
   remove ResourceRegistries_20compatibility when Plone != 2.0.x
   [fschulze]

 * Check existance of stylesheets and javascripts before registering. This
   fixes reinstallation.
   [fschulze]

 * Removed duplicate getScripts function definition in tools/JSRegistry.py
   [fschulze]

 * Fixed JSRegistry for Plone < 2.1 where plone_utils.getSiteEncoding is not
   available.
   [fschulze]

 * Renamed config.TOOLNAME to config.CSSTOOLNAME
   and config.TOOLTYPE to config.CSSTOOLTYPE
   [batlogg]

 * Added tests for attributes on stylesheets. About time.
   [elvix]

 * Added title for alternate stylesheets.
   [fschulze]

 * Removing superflous skins directories.
   [elvix]

 * Added new debugmode where stylesheets are not concatenated. This will let
   things like the DOM inspector in Mozilla point to the right line-number.
   [ldr] [elvix]

 * Added bugfix for handling disabled items when cooking stylesheets.
   [fschulze]


0.8
===

 * Renamed to ResourceRegistries instead of the historical and wrong
   CSSRegistry.
   [elvix]

 * Upgraded JSRegistry to have a more proper ZMI form, now with reordering
   support.
   [elvix]

 * Changed the order elements are added to the JSRegistry.
   [elvix]

 * Added license/copyright notice to composite files (neccesary for including
   for third party stuff).
   [elvix]

 * Bugfix fixing ZMI form for CSSRegistry.
   [fschulze]


0.7
===

 * Added to Plone 2.1 migrations, added installation of the default
   Plone javascripts and stylesheets.
   [elvix]

 * Make sure we intercept all requests for objects, even those already
   present in the acquisition chain. Override __bobo_traverse__.
   [elvix]

 * Handle cache settings in http headers for served files.
   [elvix]

 * Handle http headers for inline scripts and stylesheets.
   [elvix]

 * Use explicit </script> tag since these pages are being served as
   text/html. Both IE and firefox will have problems otherwise.
   [bmh]


0.6 and earlier
===============

 * Added a simple readme with basic documentation.
   [elvix]

 * Started HISTORY.txt (somewhat late perhaps, but better than never).
   [elvix]

 * Cleaned up forms. Better alignment.
   [elvix]

 * Separate JSRegistry and CSSRegistry to two tools.
   [elvix]

 * Lots of changes, numerous fixes.
   [elvix]


Snowsprint 2005
===============

 * Designed and built first version of the CSSregistry.
   [HammerToe] [elvix]
