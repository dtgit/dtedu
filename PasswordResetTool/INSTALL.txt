Installing the Password Reset Tool

  This product installs like almost any other CMF Product. Once
  installed it will add a new tool, some new skin objects, and
  override a few skin objects to replace the "mail forgotten
  passwords" facility with a "reset password" facility. See the README
  for details.

  Add to Products Directory

    Decompress the archive file in your Zope Products directory. In
    some installations, this will be 'zope/lib/python/Products'. If
    you have an INSTANCE_HOME setup (preferred) it will be at
    'INSTANCE_HOME/Products'.

  Install in Portal

    In the portal object you wish to install the tool, you can install
    it manually, use the Install script, or use the QuickInstaller.
    The QuickInstaller (preferred) and a lot of other neat CMF
    products can be found at
    "The CMF Collective":http://sourceforge.net/projects/collective

    QuickInstaller

      Go into the QuickInstaller page you normally use
      ('portal_quickinstaller' in the ZMI or the Plone Control Panel),
      select 'PasswordResetTool', and click 'Install'. That's it.

    Install Script

      If you don't have a QuickInstaller, you can use the install
      script manually. In your portal object, create an External Medthod
      with

          |-------------------------------------------|
          | id            | install                   |
          |-------------------------------------------|
	  | Module Name   | PasswordResetTool.Install |
          |-------------------------------------------|
          | Function Name | install                   |
          |-------------------------------------------|

      Once created, click on the script and then click on the 'Test'
      tab. The install script will run and tell you what it has done.

    Manually

      If you want, you can install the product manually. First,
      install the tools in the root of your portal object by selecting
      'PasswordResetTool' from the ZMI dropdown. Add the tool presented
      there.

      Then install the skins. Go into 'portal_skins' and select
      'Filesystem Directory View' from the ZMI pulldown. Select the
      path to the product skin directory, which is
      'Products/PasswordResetTool/skins/PasswordReset'. Click 'Add'
      without specifying a custom id. Next, in the 'Properties' tab,
      add 'PasswordReset' into the skin paths of the skins you will or
      may use. You should add it high in the path, preferrably just
      after 'custom'.

  Afterwards

    The only thing you need to do after installation is to visit
    http://localhost/passwordreset/123 (where 'localhost' is the name
    of your server.) This will give a 404 the first time. See
    README.txt for explanation.

  Customization

    PasswordResetTool is built for Plone, but should be usable in a
    vanilla CMF site that is new enough to use ZPT. If you need to
    customize the look of any pages, use the "Custom" mechanism. (If
    you do install it in a non-Plone site, please write a quick note
    back on how it went. See README for contact info.)

    If you want to use the Password Reset Tool outside a CMF site, you
    will have to make certain minor modifications. See the README for
    details.
