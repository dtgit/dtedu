PasswordResetTool 1.0

  - Providing 'fullname' now for email notification. This does not really
    close http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6680, but makes it possible to
    use the information the user provided in the mail notification (and its
    translations).

    far. We only use user id and user name.

  - Updated tests to work with Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0.
    [hannosch]

  - Converted mail_password_template from a dtml page to a Page Template, as
    dtml pages cannot be translated anymore.

  - If available use the email_charset property instead of default_charset to
    encode mails.
    [hannosch]

  - Added the portal name to the subject in the registered_notify_template.pt,
    so it's easier to distinguish those mails for various websites. This
    closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5242.

  - Replaced some last occurrences of the term member with user.
