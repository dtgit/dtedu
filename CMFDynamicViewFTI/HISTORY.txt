CMFDynamicViewFTI 3.0.1 - Released October 7, 2007

    - Copied addWithPresettings.pt from GenericSetup 1.3 branch r79408. This
      fixes a startup error in buildouts caused by the move to an egg.
      [fschulze]

    - Adding a Dynamic View FTI through ZMI is back. This closes
      https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6976
      [glenfant]

    - Removed migrate module, which didn't work in CMF 2.1 anymore. Use
      GenericSetup profiles for handling portal types instead. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6899.

      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 3.0b1 - Released May 1, 2007

    - Updated some import locations. We require a minimum of Zope 2.10 now.
      [hannosch]

    - Rename menus - turns out dotted names don't really work with the ZCML
      magic that's creating interfaces on the fly (it's akin to having a
      variable name with a dot in it)
      [optilude]

    - Use new displayviews menu to find view titles; rework Z3 view test to use
      a test zcml file.
      [mj]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 2.1.2 - Released April 22, 2007

    - Removed bogus test setup. All the stuff is done by the layer anyway.
      [stefan]

    - Removed tests/runalltests.py and tests/framework.py.
      To run tests use Zope's testrunner:
      ./bin/zopectl test --nowarn -s Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI
      [stefan]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 2.1.1 - Released February 10, 2007

    - Removed the view alias of index.html, as this would block uploading of
      files called index.html into folders. You can enable this in your own
      types if you want.
      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 2.1.0 - Released September 8, 2006

    - Implemented fallback to default view:
      If a selected view (i.e. template) does not exist, return the
      default view instead of - ultimately - NotFound. You can enable this
      option by setting the FTI's new 'default_view_fallback' property to True.
      [stefan]

    - Converted dummy test sample types to be extension profile based. This
      profile is only registered during test runs.
      [hannosch]

    - Slightly adjusted the tests to new CTC version.
      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 2.0.0 - Released May 15, 2006

    - Merged z3-views-integration branch.
      [svincic]

    - Making use of Zope 3 interfaces with proper reverse bridges.
      [optilude]

    - Fix tests to pass if Five/Zope3 is installed.
      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.4 - Released March 19, 2006

    - Made 'safe_callable' truly safe by using 'safe_hasattr'.
    - Made tests use CMFTestCase. There is no Plone dependency whatsoever.
    - Fixed a bug in getViewMethod. A present, but empty 'layout' attribute
      now also returns the default view instead of ''. Returning the empty
      string sends PortalContent.__call__() into a loop.
      [stefan]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.3 - Released February 25, 2006

    - Added conditional import for typeClasses to make the code CMF1.6
      compatible while staying CMF1.5 backwards compatible.
      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.2 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Change getViewMethod's 'enforce_available' argument to default to False
      instead of True. If someone goes to the trouble of either using python
      or adding a property to indicate a specific template as the default
      layout, we should let them.
      [rafrombrc]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.1 - Released August 9, 2005

    - Improved Plone 2.1 integration: getDefaultPage. Replace try/except with a
      better checking for Plone. Bonus: whitespaces cleanup.
      [deo]

    - Stop acquisation for default_page.
      [panjunyong]
