# Changes in release 1.4 (2008-XX-XX)

- Plone-3 compatibility added and deprecation warning removed

- Partly migration to GenericSetup

# Changes in release 1.3 (2007-06-27)

- ECFolders and assignment boxes now have an "analysis" tab which 
  provides more information about contained assignments, e.g., number
  of attempts users needed for an assignment or number of submissions 
  per day.

- The "assignments (full)" view (shows the full text of all assignments
  on one page) is now integrated in the "assignments" tab.

- New content type ECAssignmentTask, which can be used to build a
  repository of assignments; ECAssignmentTask objects can be
  referenced from ECAssignmentBoxes.

- If an assignment box is located inside an ECLecture object which
  requires registration, submissions are only allowed for users
  enrolled in the course.

# Changes in release 1.2 (2007-02-28)

- Added field "Maximum number of attempts" to ECAssignmentBox to
  restrict the number of resubmissions.

- Implemented issue #118: For box owners and managers it is now
  possible make submissions even if the assignment box is in state
  'public draft' or 'private', and to make any number of
  resubmissions.

- In the "assignments" view:

  - If there is more than one assignment box inside an ECFolder one
    will see a table for each box.  Clicking the check box in one of
    the tables' header will check or uncheck all entries inside this
    table only and *not* all entries in all tables.

  - Now it is possible to toggle the view of superseded assignments.

  - Added clickable workflow states (assignments can now be filtered
    by workflow state).

  - Added delete button and polished the "change state" controls.

- As addition to the "assignments" view, owners and managers can use
  the "assignments (full)" tab to see the full text of all assignments
  on one page.

- If the parent of an assignment box is an ECFolder and this ECFolder
  contains directions, the directions will be shown inside a
  collapsible box on top of the assignment box.

- Fixed issue #119: Uploads can now be any size.

- Fixed issue #120: Students do not see shared assignments of other
  users in the "statistics" view.

- Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where
  possible.
