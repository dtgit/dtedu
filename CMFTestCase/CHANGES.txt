0.9.7
- The CMFSite layer can now be set up more than once.

0.9.6
- Deal with new skin setup in CMF 2.1 and up.
- Provide hasPackage and installPackage if ZopeTestCase supports it.
- Use new stateless GenericSetup API in CMF 2.1 and up.

0.9.4
- Minor test fixes to cater for changes in CMF.

0.9.2
- Added support for local component registries. We now call setSite() on the
  portal before importing profiles and before each test.

0.9.0
- Added CMF21 constant.
- Prepared for switching ZopeTestCase to Zope3 interfaces.
- Load etc/site.zcml lazily instead of using the wrapper.
- Import extension profiles one by one to gain better control.
- Added a CMFTestCase.addProfile() method that allows to import
  extension profiles into the site. This is an alternative to
  passing the 'extension_profiles' argument to setupCMFSite().
- Create the CMF site lazily using layer.CMFSite.
- Renamed utils.py to five.py.

0.8.6
- Made sure layer cleanup resets Five.zcml to "not initialized".

  Thanks to Whit Morris.

  to the setupCMFSite function.

0.7.0
- Updated to CMF 1.5.
- Added an API module, ctc.py.
- Added an addProduct() method to CMFTestCase that allows to add a product
  to the portal. This is as alternative to passing a 'products' argument
  to setupCMFSite().
- CMFTestCase now uses the version independend 'transaction' module provided
  by ZopeTestCase >= 0.9.8.

0.6.0 (not released)
- setupCMFSite() now accepts a 'products' argument which allows to specify
  a list of products that will be added to the portal by executing their
  respective Extensions.Install.install() methods.
- Removed setupCMFSkins() and the ability to setup a CMF site w/o skins.
- Made the ZopeTestCase.utils module available as CMFTestCase.utils.
