Products.CMFCore Changelog

  Products.CMFCore 2.1.1 (2008/01/06)

    - exportimport.content: Add simple guard against import failures when
      the ".objects" file contains empty lines.
      (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/176328)


  Products.CMFCore 2.1.1-beta (2007/12/29)

    - Events: Fixed some handleContentishEvent issues.
      Moved _clearLocalRolesAfterClone code to separate handler that is
      triggered before indexing and also for folders. Made sure notifyModified
      is not called if objects are just moved.

    - PortalObject: Added setSite to getSiteManager for old instances. This
      fixes migrations from Plone 2.1 to 3.0.

    - FSImage: Supply class-level defaults for 'alt', 'height', and 'width',
      to avoid acquiring objects with the same names.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/507)

    - Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.

    - PortalObject: Fixed a bug in the site manager creation code, which would
      assign the __parent__ pointer to the Aq-wrapper and not the actual
      object.
