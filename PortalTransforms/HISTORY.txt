========================

  * note for release-managers: The version-bump to 1.5 was a bit early, but now 
    as we have it, i keep it and next release number in the cycle needed for
    Archetypes 1.4.2 (used for Plone 2.5.2) of PortalTransforms is then the 1.5
    final.
    We dont need increasing of release numbers because of Plone 3.0, 
    Archetypes 1.5, ... if theres no change in the dependen product, like 
    this one.

========================

1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25

    in CMFPlone just zero for non-int-castable values.
    [jensens]

  * the values in the safe_html valid tag dictionary can become strings when
    modifying them via the ZMI. Explicitly convert them to integers before

    with the same functionality. Migration is handled on reinstall.
    http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4538
    [csenger] [dreamcatcher]

  * Removed CoUnInitialize call. According to Mark Hammond: The
    right thing to do is call that function, although almost noone
    does (including pywin32 itself, which does CoInitialize the main
    thread) and I've never heard of problem caused by this
    omission.
    [sidnei]

  * Fix a long outstanding issue with improper COM thread model

    errors when someone else has already initialized differently.

1.3.2-5 - 2004-10-17
====================

   inside the mapping.
   [dreamcatcher]

1.3.2-1 - 2004-09-04

   [dreamcatcher]
