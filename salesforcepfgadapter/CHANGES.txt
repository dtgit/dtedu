(svn/unreleased)

- Modification [developer's name]

1.0 - released April 4, 2008

- Added test coverage of onSuccess, the critical piece in ensuring that
  our form values make their way into Salesforce.com as the appropriate
  SFObject type with configured mapping.  I suppose test coverage of
  the main functionality is okay during an rc cycle :) [andrewb]

1.0rc2

- Using proper Generic Setup API "runAllImportStepsFromProfile", rather
  than deprecated "setImportContext".  For more information, see the very helpful:
  http://www.nabble.com/Product-install-regression--td14165955.html#a14165955 [andrewb]

- Cleaning up naughty "import *" statement within Install.py [andrewb]

1.0rc1

- Providing test and migration for legacy adapters that didn't have the 
  capability to mark required fields in the UI [andrewb, jessesnyder]

- Renaming the Salesforce PFG Adapter's archetype_name to Salesforce 
  Adapter, in attempt to increase non-technical accessibility.
  Provided migration for the same [andrewb, jessesnyder]

 - Add zope security checks to methods in the SalesforcePFGAdapter class [jessesnyder]

 - Tweaked i18n infrastructure and added German translation. [davisagli]

 - Don't show extraneous schemata in Plone3 [jessesnyder]
 
 - Ran Zope's test coverage feature against our code base and extended test coverage
   to key parts of the public aspects of our code base [andrewb]

 - Implement IMultiPageSchema so that schemata can be processed separately and in order, since
   the field mapping schemata depends on the default schemata being submitted first. [jessesnyder]
   
 - Re-ordered the adapter's schemata to put 'field mapping' before
   'overrides'. [davisagli]

 - Worked around FGDateField issue to format submitted dates properly for Salesforce.com input.  
   Used DateTime.HTML4() method on field value [ghnatiuk, davisagli]

 - Adding labeling to the field mapping ui to show those fields for the 
   chosen SFObject, which are non-nillable (i.e required) and don't have a 
   computed value (i.e. as in a unique id, which is required but you have no 
   control over) [jessesnyder, andrewb]
   
 - Sorting of fields that are required first, then those that are optional
   second in the field mapping ui [jessesnyder, andrewb]

1.0-alpha2

 - Worked around issue where the DataGridField strips proceeding/trailing spaces for its FixedRow 
   values, but our generateFormFieldRows method did not, thus each save of the adapter produced duplicate
   mappings in the DataGridField UI [jessesnyder, andrewb]

 - Providing custom mutator for the field map user interface, which now auto-cleans up those fields
   that have been removed or re-titled [jessesnyder, andrewb]

1.0-alpha1

 - Initial import and creation of standalone product initially created at the following branch:
   http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneFormGen/branches/salesforce_adapter_branch/
