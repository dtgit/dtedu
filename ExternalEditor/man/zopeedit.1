.TH zopeedit 1 "Aug 12, 2004" "Zope External Editor"
.SH NAME
.B zopeedit
\- helper application that handles the interaction between the Zope ExternalEditor product and the client side applications

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B This program is intended to be called by the web browser in response to the application/x\-zope\-edit MIME type, and is not meant to be called directly by the user except for debugging or testing purposes.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Most web browsers should respect the MIME handling instructions in the /etc/mailcap metamail capabilities file, where an entry should have automatically been placed by the system to let zopeedit handle the application/x\-zope\-edit MIME type.

However, if your web browser does not respect mailcap, or if it was not automatically updated during installation, you can simply specify

.B /usr/bin/zopeedit

as a new helper application in your web browser of choice to handle downloads of MIME type

.B application/x\-zope\-edit

for you to be able to edit Zope objects using your favourite editor.

Further customization may be made after the first run of the helper application on the file

.B ~/.zope\-external\-edit

More information on configuration and debugging are available in the upstream author's home page at <http://www.zope.org/Members/Caseman/ExternalEditor>.
