1.5.0-final - 2006-12-15
========================

  * note for release-managers: The version-bump to 1.5 was a bit early, but now 
    as we have it, i keep it and next release number in the cycle needed for
    Archetypes 1.4.2 (used for Plone 2.5.2) of PortalTransforms is then the 1.5
    final.
    We dont need increasing of release numbers because of Plone 3.0, 
    Archetypes 1.5, ... if theres no change in the dependend product, like 
    this one.
