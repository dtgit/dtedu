Changelog for ExtendedPathIndex

   (name of developer listed in brackets)

2.4 - Released September 11, 2006

    - Relaxed a check for path only allowing strings so far. Now we except all
      basestrings. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5617.

    - Converted log infrastructure to use Python's logging module instead zLOG.

2.3 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Added some extra debug information when an improper path is cataloged.

2.2 - Released October 7, 2005

    - Add seperate index structures on the parent path and the full path of all
      objects.  This significantly improves scaling for navtrees, breadcrumbs,
      and listings.
      [alecm]

    - Assume that EPI is used inside same container as content and use relative
      search instead of absolute - basically transforming / plonesite search
      to / search with startlevel set to 1 instead of 0.

2.1 - Released May 20, 2005

    - Implement 'indexed_attrs' support for ExtendedPathIndex.

    - Prevent navigation tree queries from stopping prematurely if the
      queried-for path does not actually exist in the index, but its parents do.

1.0

    - Path index capable of generating a navigation tree structure from
      cataloged data.
