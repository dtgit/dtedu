<!-- This file shows how properties can be set on a Plone Site portal.
     For instance, how to add new views (selectable from the 'Display' menu)
     to the Plone portal.

 <!-- Templates that can be chosen from the 'Display' content menu are
      defined in the "selectable_views" property.
      Note: use 'purge="False"' if you just want to add one or more views to
      the original list. If you don't you'll have to define the list of all
      elements explicitly.
      Note: there is no support for insert-before/insert-after with property
      in properties.xml, unlike with skin-path layers in skins.xml.
      -->
<!-- EXAMPLE (UNCOMMENT TO MAKE AVAILABLE):
 <property name="selectable_views" purge="False">
  <element value="folder_listing"/>
  <element value="news_listing"/>
 </property>
