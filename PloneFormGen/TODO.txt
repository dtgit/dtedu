TODO.txt

* i18n hooks for configlet

* Make RichText Field work for anonymous clients.

* File field needs validators for mimetype -- particularly text

* Need a tool where portal admin may select string validators,
  default values for site.

* Find a way to do fieldsets

* Need a flag for fields types that should not be displayed. Keeping a
  list is not good enough and will not allow for easy addition of fields.

* Fix warning of no default action -- may not be possible.

* Even text file uploads handled via save data adapter may have encoding
  issues.

* Will we have a performance issue if saved data gets large?

* Translator for Archetypes' validators hostile messages.
  See http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/3865 for some ideas on i18n.

* Refactor validation. The form should probably call the fields.
  Watch out for expression cache problems.
