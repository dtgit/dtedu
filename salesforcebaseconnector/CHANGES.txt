Change history
==============

   [davisagli]

 - Don't use trademarked Salesforce.com icon.
   [davisagli]

1.0c1 (2008-12-22)

 - Protect the base connector's query, queryMore, retrieve, getDeleted, and
   getUpdated methods with the 'Manage portal' permission instead of making
   them publicly traversable.  Note that this means any restricted Python
   calling these methods (e.g. page templates or Python scripts) will need
   to use a proxy role that has this permission in order to continue functioning.
   [davisagli]

 - Don't display a configured password in the configuration form. [davisagli]

 - Refactored credentials check so that invalid credentials will result in a warning
   shown to the user, rather than failing silently.  This closes issue #2. [andrewb, davisagli]
   
 - Integration test suites all based on CMFTestCase and creation of CMF Site,
   rather than PloneTestCase and Plone site for performance reasons [andrewb]

1.0-alpha3

 - Added new publicly supported API "listFieldsRequiredForCreation" which
   encapsulates some of the rules for which fields are required upon object
   creation via the SOAP API for Salesforce.com.  The benefit being that 
   additional packages need not reproduce the following, which may evolve 
   anyway:
   
     not fieldData.nillable and \
        not fieldData.defaultedOnCreate and \
        fieldData.createable
        
    listFieldsRequiredForCreation accepts a Salesforce Object type as its
    lone required argument (Jesse Snyder)

 - Removing unneeded portal_skins FSDV (Jesse Snyder) 

 - Improved docstrings for interfaces (Jesse Snyder)


1.0-alpha2

 - Updating CMFCore permission imports to work with CMF-2.1.0 (Emyr Thomas)
 - Tested with Plone 3.0 final (Andrew Burkhalter)

1.0-alpha1

 - Initial import and creation of standalone product
