Ingeniweb : test case for GroupUserFolder


This is an implementation of ZopeTestCase framework for this product.

To run the tests easily, you can try the runtests.sh shell script from the
current directory. Yes it is ugly (!) but it is convenient for me as I've
several python installs.

The shell script will eventually be changed to something easier to use.

Alternatively, you can use testrunner this way :

python PathToZope/utilities/testrunner.py -q -i -a -d .
