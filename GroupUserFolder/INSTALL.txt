HOW TO INSTALL GRUF?

  GRUF installs just like any other Zope product. Just untar it in your Products directory,
  restart Zope, and you're done.

HOW TO USE GRUF?

  To enjoy groups within Zope, you just have to instansiate a GroupUserFolder instead of your
  UserFolder. GRUF creates two default acl_users for you inside itself (one for Users and one
  for Groups. see README.txt for technical explanation) but you can remove them and replace
  them by other kind of User Folders: LDAPUserFolder, SQLUserFolder, SimpleUserFolder,
  or whatever suits your needs.

PLONE INSTALLATION
