    group.
    [encolpe]

v3.54.4 - 2007-04-29

  * Death to tabindexes!
    [limi]

    [stefan]

v3.54 - 2006-09-19
  * Fix a bug with LDAPUserFolder where another UserFolder was returned when LUF
    was requested [jvloothuis]

v3.53 - 2006-09-08
  * Removed refresh.txt. You should add this locally if you want to use it.
    [hannosch]

  * getUsers: efficiency improvement: anti-double user inclusion is done by
    checking key presence in a dict instead of looking up name in a list
    [b_mathieu]

  * Fix searchUsersByAttribute returning twice the same user id when a second
    source is present
    [b_mathieu]

  * Plone 2.1 service release

v3.51 - 2006-05-15

  * Changed getLocalRolesForDisplay to check for 'Manage properties' instead of

    Anonymous can no longer get at local roles information this way.
    Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5492
    [stefan]

  * Remove some noise log message and the product name parameter from ToolInit.
    [hannosch]

    added or removed from a group
    [bmh]

  * Dynamically fixed the remaining bug in folder_localrole_form.

  * Now the users tab in ZMI allow you to search a user (useful w/ LDAP)

  * Fixed a bug in Plone 2.0 UI when searching a large set of users

  * Added a 'wizard' tab to help in managing LDAP sources.

  * Fixed getProperty in GroupDataTool not to acquire properties.
    [panjunyong]

[v3.3 - 20050725]

  * Added an 'enable/disable' feature on the sources. Now, you can entierly
    disable a users source without actually removing it. Very useful for
    testing purposes!

  * Removed an optimization when user is None in authenticate(), so
    than you can use GRUF with CASUserFolder (thanks to Alexandre
    Sauv?mr.lex@free.fr>)

  * Fixed 1235351 (possible infinite recursion in an audit method)

  * Fixed [ 1243323 ] GRUF: bug in createGrouparea() in GroupsTool.py

  * Fixed a missing import in GroupsTool.py (http://plone.org/collector/4209)
    [hannosch]

  * Fixed a nested groups issue with LDAPUserFolder. This is not a widely
    used schema with ldap anyway.
    [pjgrizel]

  * Fixed LDAPUserFolderAdapter's search_by_dn bug: search by _login_attr
    but not _rdnattr
    [panjunyong]

  * _getLocalRolesForDisplay was marking users as groups for groups that had
    the same as users (http://plone.org/collector/3711).  Made unit tests run
    even if LDAPUserFolder is not installed.
    [alecm]

[v3.2 - 20050307]

  Service release.

[v3.2RC2 - 20050305]

  * Now your user sources (especially LUF) can have a 'portait' property which
    will be used as your user's portrait. This works only in 'preview.txt'-mode.

  * You can put a 'notifyGroupAreaCreated' in your 'groups' folder as you would
    be able to put a 'notifyMemberAreaCreated' in your 'members' folder.
    So you can execute some code at group area creation. Thanks to F. Carlier !

  * Added a helper table on the sources tab to help managing LUF group mappings

  * Fixed a bug in Zope 2.7 preventing the zope quickstart page to show up.
    A hasUsers() method was missing from GRUF's API.

  * Fixed a bug in ZMI which prevented LUF cached users to be individually
    managed by GRUF.


[v3.2RC1 - 20041215]

  * _doChangeUser and _doChangeGroup lost existing groups if the groups argument
    was omitted. Fixed these and the Zope 2.5-style APIs accordingly.
    [stefan]

  * Updated API to have a better conformance to the original Zope API.
    Thanks to Stefan H Holek for this clever advice.

  * Uncommented cache clearing code in _doChangeUser as it appears to be required.
    [stefan]

  * Added a Plone 2.0 optional patch to improve LDAP and groups management.
    It's basically a preview of what will be done in Plone 2.1 for users managment.
    For example, now, you can assign local roles to users in your LDAP directory,
    EVEN if they're not in the cache in folder_localrole_form.
    Other "preview" features will come later. Please read README and PloneFeaturePreview.py
    files for more explanations on these.

  * Made manage_GRUFUsers page a little faster with LDAP by preventing users count.

  * Fixed [ 1051387 ] addGroup fails if type 'Folder' is not implicitly addable.

  * Fixed other minor or cosmetic bugs

  * Group mapping is automatically created by LDAPGroupFolder when you create a group
    with its interface.

v3_1_1 - 20040906

  * Fixed a bug in getProperty() - it always returned None !

  * Fixed a bug which caused AUTHENTICATED_USER source id to be invalid

v3_1 - 20040831

  * Group-to-role mapping now works for LDAPGroupFolder

  * Debug mode now allows broken source not to be checken against

  * Reindexing new GroupSpace objects
    2004/03/10 Maik Rder

  * Speedup improvements by Heldge Tesdal

  * Fixed ZMI overview refreshing bug

  * GroupsTool method createGrouparea now calls the GroupSpace
    method setInitialGroup with the group that it is created for.
    In case this method does not exists, the default behaviour
    is employed. This is done so that the GroupSpace can decide on its
    own what the policy should be regarding the group that it is
    initially created for.
    See the implementation of GrufSpaces for an example of how this
    can be used in order to give the initial group the role GroupMember.
    2004/02/25 Maik Rder

  * Removed GroupSpace code, which can now be found in
    http://ingeniweb.sourceforge.net/Products/GrufSpaces

  * Many performance improvements (tree and audit views)

  * Fixed a recursion pb. on the left pane tree (!)

  * Added a batch view for "overview" page when there's more than

  * Major ZMI improving, including everywhere-to-everywhere links,

    than 50, to avoid having server outage)

  * Improved performance

    This bug showed-up with LDAPUserFolder.

  * getId() bug fixing (see ChangeLog)

v0_2 - 20030331

  * Users are now acquired correctly, which prevents you from hotfixing anything !!! :-)

  * This fixed Zope 2.5 w/ Plone bug

  * Better log reporting

  * Validated with LDAPUserFolder and SimpleUserFolder

v0_1 - 20021126

  * User creation is now supported

  * Fixed a bug (with an axe) that prevented Zope module Owner.py code to work.
    The Owner.py calls aq_inner and aq_parent methods on a User object to get its
    security context. So it found the underlying User object instead of the GRUF
    itself. So we fixed this by setting dummy UserFolder-context methods on the
    GRUFUser objects. This is ugly and should be fixed later by acquiring the
    underlying User object from a better context.

  * Fixed getUserName in GRUFUser that returned group names without the "group"
    prefix.

  * Fixed various "cosmetic" bugs

  * Documented the whole stuff

v0_0 - 20021126

  Started to work on this wonderful product.
