Comparing CMF types with ATContentTypes

 This is a very roughe and short list of differences between the old CMF types
 and the new ATContentTypes types.

  * Archetypes: All types are written with Archetypes and have all features
    default Archetypes based types have like:

     o autogenerated edit forms based on the schema

     o referenceable

     o Easily enhanceable by subclassing or adding fields to the schema

     o Transformations like restructured text, python source code highlighting,
       pdf to html, office to html and many more.

     o plugable validation of fields

  * Clean and documented API.

  * Translateable using LinguaPlone.
    
  * Dynamic Views: All types are using the new dynamic view FTI that allows you
    to choose the view template per instance. You can configure the templates in
    the portal_types tool. This features is used to turn an ordinary folder into
    a photo album by simple switching to a different view.
    
  * Permissions per type and feature: Every type has its own add permission and
    all features like template mixin have their own modify permission, too.

  * Numerous small adjustments and enhancements to all types for example:

    o Images can be rotated through the web and have exif informations

    o News Items have an image plus caption

    o Events have a body text

    o Documents have a history tab to show the last changes as an unified diff
      view using the ZODB history.
