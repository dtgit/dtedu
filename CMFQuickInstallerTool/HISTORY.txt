    (name of developer listed in brackets)

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.4 - Released December 2, 2007

    - Added metadata.xml to GenericSetup profile.
      [hannosch]

    - Avoid breakage for InstalledProduct instances without the left or
      rightslots properties. Thx to Roberto Fontanarosa from the OpenCpi
      division of Cpi Progetti Spa.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed logging code in utils. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7093.
      [bliles, hannosch]

    - Reverted getUtility usage. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7314.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed class variables in InstalledProduct. All products would share the
      same left slots and right slots properties. Thx to Saverio Mucci for
      noting this.
      [hannosch]

    - Avoid an unneeded transaction savepoint.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.3 - Released July 9, 2007

    - Use new GenericSetup features, so we don't have to change the current
      setup tool context anymore.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.2b3 - Released May 1, 2007

    - Back to getToolByName.
      [wichert]

    - Added uninstall support for utilities. All additional utilities installed
      by a product are now recorded and uninstalled properly.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.2b2 - Released March 23, 2007

    - Added new profile argument to the installProduct method to explicitly set
      the profile which should be used for installation.
      [hannosch]

    - Marked the Products.CMFQI package as uninstallable as well.
      [hannosch]

    - Replaced all getToolByName calls by get/queryUtility.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.2b1 - Released March 5, 2007

    - Don't show removed products in the standard listings.
      [hannosch]

    - Adjusted listInstallable and listInstalled methods to return the title of
      the GenericSetup profile instead of the package name, for extension
      profile based installation. These look a lot nicer ;) This fixes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6129.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.1 - Released February 10, 2007

    - Adjusted installProduct method to be compatible with CMF 2.1 (including
      the conversion of tools as utilities).
      [hannosch]

    - Refactored ResourceRegistries support not to require the product itself to
      be installed in QI.
      [hannosch]

    - Added the INonInstallable interface that is used to look up utilities
      which provide a list of non-installable products. This allows applications
      to exclude certain products from the list of installable products.
      [hannosch]

    - Added an option to omit snapshot creation which defaults to True to speed
      up test runs and migrations.
      [hannosch]

    - We automatically create a GenericSetup snapshot before and after
      installation now, so you can at least compare the changes a product did
      during installation. We have no better uninstall yet, though.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 2.0.0 - Released October 25, 2006

    - Slightly optimize for GenericSetup profile based installations.
      [hannosch]

    - Adjusted actions installation tracking to work with CMF 2.1+.
      [hannosch]

    - Made profile based installation work with CMF 2.1+. The profile id may use
      the full package name now, instead of only the product name (for example:
      Products.CMFCalendar instead of CMFCalendar).
      [hannosch]

    - Changed GS profile registration to be zcml based. Fixed some problems with
      the logging calls. Removed some stale code from the tests.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed lots of unused and bbb code. This version requires at least CMF 1.6.
      [hannosch]

    - Added support for GenericSetup extension profile-based installation.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.6.1 - Released April 28, 2007

    - Disabled postonly protection for product reinstall. This broke the reinstall
      functionality on the Plone control panel. The postonly protection can be
      enabled once the control panel is changed.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.6.0 - Released April 22, 2007

    - Applied postonly protection to product uninstall and reinstall.
      [alecm]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.5.9 - Released June 1, 2006

    - Fixed two missing imports in utils.py. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5529.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool - 1.5.8 Released May 15, 2006

    - Some general spring cleaning.
      [hannosch]

    - Avoid DeprecationWarning for product_name.
      [hannosch]

    - Added methods to display Products directory and debug mode (if enabled)
      [joelburton]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.5.7 - Released December 23, 2005

    - Cook resources when new types were added and ResourceRegistries is
      installed.
      [fschulze]

    - If we are reinstalling do not say the product is already installed if we
      see an exception but show the real error message
      [wichert]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.5.6 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Fix missing import in utils.py. This closes
      http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4817.
      [hannosch]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.5.5

    - Keeping track of ResourceRegistries entries.
      [zwork]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.5.4

    - listInstalledProducts and listInstallableProducts now return alphabetized
      lists.
      [geoffd]

    - Catch errors where the product is there but install cannot by compiled,
      this picks up syntax errors and adds the them to an errors dict.
      When listInstallableProducts is called, the errors dict is repoulated.
      Also added in a few except ConflictErrors.
      [andym]

    - Fixing plone bug #3113, where the "uninstall" button would raise an
      exception if no items were selected; this makes the uninstallProducts()
      method symmetric with the installProducts() method
      [optilude]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.5.3

    - Added an Extensions.Install module and an initial test suite.
      [stefan]

    - Added optional reinstall argument to install() and uninstall() method
      [tiran]

    - Enabled uninstall of deleted products by making the parser.py handle
      missing product directories slightly more gracefully.
      [tesdal]

    - Fixed multiple register bug

      QI doesn't assign an object to a product when it is already registered
      for another product. This fixes bugs like the removal of the archetype
      tool when a product was removed which itself had had installed Archetypes.
      [tiran]

    - Added afterInstall / beforeUninstall hooks:

      out = afterInstall(portal, reinstall=reinstall, qi_product)
      out, cascade = beforeUninstall(portal, reinstall, qi_product, cascade)
      [tiran]

CMFQuickInstallerTool 1.4

    - reinstall button

      does the same as uninstall/install except that it does _not_ delete
      objects that have been created on portal_level (portal_objects)

    - product version info

      added getProductVersion to the API
      shows the version of the products
      for installed products it also shows the version of the prod at install time

    - By Andy McKay

      Remove the except: pass from trying to make a External method, if there is
      an error in the import log the error to ZLOG. Unfortunately there is a
      string error we have to try and catch as well. That string error occurs
      when the module cant be found, so we should ignore that.

    - content type registry support 

      QuickInstaller now also tracks entries in the content_type_registry.

    - if products have been removed from disc, mark them in the installed list as 'removed'

    - added a ChangeLog :)
