<p class="discreet">
If you're seeing this instead of the web site you were expecting, the owner of
this web site has just installed Plone. Do not contact the Plone Team 
or the Plone mailing lists about this.
</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>

<p>
Before you start exploring your newly created Plone site, please do the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure you are logged in as an admin/manager user.
        <span class="discreet">(You should see a Site Setup link in the top right corner)</span></li>
    <li><a href="@@mail-controlpanel">Set up your mail server</a>. <span class="discreet">(Plone needs a valid SMTP server to verify users and send out password reminders)</span></li>
    <li><a href="@@security-controlpanel">Decide what security level you want on your site</a>. <span class="discreet">(Who can join, password policies, etc)</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Get comfortable</h2>

<p>After that, we suggest you do one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Find out <a class="link-plain" href="http://plone.org/products/plone/features/3.0">What's new in Plone 3.0</a>.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Make it your own</h2>

<p>Plone has a lot of different settings that can be used to make it do what you want it to. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Try out a different theme, either pick from 
    <a href="@@skins-controlpanel">the included ones</a>, or one of the 
    <a class="link-plain" 
       href="http://plone.org/products/by-category/themes">available themes 
       from plone.org</a>. <span class="discreet">(Make sure the theme is 
       compatible with the version of Plone you are currently using)</span>
    </li>

    <li>
    <a href="@@types-controlpanel">
    Decide what kind of workflow you want in your site.</a>
    <span class="discreet">(The default is a
    website-centric workflow, if you want to use Plone as a closed intranet, 
    you should adjust your workflow settings accordingly)</span>
    </li>

    <li>
    By default, Plone uses a visual editor for content. 
    <span class="discreet">(If you prefer text-based syntax and/or wiki 
        syntax, you can change this in the
    <a href="@@markup-controlpanel">markup control panel</a>)</span>
    </li>

    <li>&hellip;and many more settings are available in the 
        <a href="plone_control_panel">Site Setup</a>.
    </li>
    
</ul>
