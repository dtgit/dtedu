About Plone

  Plone is a user friendly Content Management System running on top of 
Python, Zope and the CMF.  

  It benefits from all features of Zope/CMF such as: RDBMS integration,
Python/Perl extensions, Object Oriented Database, Web configurable workflow,

many many other features.  Available protocols: FTP, XMLRPC, HTTP, WEBDAV
